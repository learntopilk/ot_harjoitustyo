You'll see this:
![Game screen](countryselection.png)

Or almost. in the beginning, all countries are beige. Two players will pick countries one by one.

After all countries are selected, the troop value (not displayed yet) of each country will be added up. This is the number of troops each player can deploy.

Units are deployed one by one, turn by turn.

Full game instructions are included in the game.
