# MRisk

MRisk is a minimal implementation of the classic board game Risk. As a minimal requirement, the game will allow two human players to play a full game of Risk against each other in the Southeastern United States.

I hope to be able to add more/larger maps once the map mechanics are better defined.

## Update on development

The application is progressing slowly. At the moment, I'm working on country mechanics, colors, and basic selecting. Once that is done, I'll complete all player functionality for a full test. 

After these are done, I will create the whole map. No point
